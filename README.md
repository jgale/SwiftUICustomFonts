# SwiftUICustomFonts
This is a small SwiftUI only app that demonstrates how to use custom fonts, where the custom fonts are contained in a Swift Package Manager (SPM) module. Crucially, the custom fonts will still work in Xcode Previews. 

It also demonstrates how to display SwiftUI views from a different module that contain image assets, and continue to have the Xcode Previews work without crashing.
